Business Requirements for this Project:

•	An online, user friendly form that can be accessed through our webpage with the following fields:

        o	Guest name,
        o	(possibly guest email address), 
        o	VIP Category (see current procedure document), 
        o	date of visit, 
        o	time of visit (allowing for parking time, etc.), 
        o	name of requestor, 
        o	requestor’s email address, and
        o	sponsoring department.

•	A way to funnel these request to our customer service area for approval (Approved, Declined/Processed) and processing.

•	A way to assign location where the guest will be parking (location = VIP Lot –or- Any Lot). 

•	The system should be able to:

        o	Generate a permit,
	Name of Guest,
	date and time of visit,
	parking location.
        o	send the permit to requestor (and guest ???),
        o	provide a gate code specific to the date of visit (we have a spreadsheet with random, codes we generated),
        o	provide a map to the VIP Lot or link to map at:  http://www.regis.edu/~/media/9B3B59E289BD495FA3D64210BF9774B7.ashx.

•	We also need a way to generate reports by date, VIP category, spaces used, and department.

•	We also need the ability to enter large events into the system, without them having to go through the website. 


WE WOULD LIKE:

•	A way to limit requests to Regis staff and faculty.

•	A way for the online user to know if the lot is already full or close to full (ex., red “light” means lot is at capacity, yellow “light” means the lot is close to full, green “light” means space is available ).  Maybe an incorporated calendar of reservations?
